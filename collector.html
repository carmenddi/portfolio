            <p>The Omega Speedmaster Professional was the watch from which it all began. With a 42 mm case diameter, small seconds dial, 30-minute and 12-hour counters and chronograph hand, the watch is perhaps the most famous among chronographs, because it was the only wristwatch to overcome NASA's arduous selection to equip the Apol astronauts with a reliable chronograph. That's how the Omega Speedmaster cal. 321 ref. 145. 012 worn by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin">Buzz Aldrin</a> was the first watch to land on the moon. Calibre 321 was replaced by calibre 861 before and calibre 1861 after.<br><br>

            <p>Tudor Black Bay 58 was my graduation gift. Tudor's diver line was born in 1958 when the first submarine crossed the Arctic ice cap of the North Pole. It was this feat that inspired the maison that began to produce diver watches with a resistance of up to 20 atmospheres. Even the model in question, with 39 mm case diameter, can count on a waterproofness of 200 m. The recent history of Tudor presents us with a brand always full of innovations, so much so that many of the new diver and chrono models are increasingly difficult to find in dedicated stores, so we rely on the reseller market which still has average prices.<br><br>

            <p>Scandinavian Airlines System in 1950s commissioned to Universal Genéve the production of a watch resistant to magnetic fields capable of flying over the North Pole, in order to reduce the duration of America-Europe journeys. Universal Geneve entrusts the design of the watch to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%A9rald_Genta">Gerald Genta</a>. In 1954 the watch was presented to the public under the name of 'Polarouter', a name that changed the following year to become 'Polerouter'. The watch has a very exclusive and elegant appearance, given by the gold plating of the case and the small size of 35mm. For a very short time (maximum 2 years), the watch is equipped with the automatic hammer or bumper caliber 138SS, like the watch in question. In 1958 the new automatic caliber 215 with micro-rotor was introduced, which was perfected over the years until 1969, the last year of production of the polerouter.<br><br>

            <p>The "Le Must" collection represents an important milestone for Cartier. After the death of the famous Louis Cartier, his successors struggled to keep the company going, which was facing a long dark period. Thirty years after his death, the maison was acquired by a group of investors and it would be the "Le Must" line, together with some restyling of famous models, to revive the company, bringing it back to the privileged position it deserved to have. The watches of this particular line had more affordable prices, thanks to the use of gold-plated silver, often fitted with quartz movements and their birth is also due to the company's willingness to counter the counterfeit market, selling Cartier watches at more affordable prices. Here in the photo you can see my manual-winding Must de Cartier watch, with a gold-plated case measuring 23x31mm, with a particular and refined burgundy dial.<br><br>

            <p>It reads Seiko 7A, it means the first quartz chronographs in history. The family was born with the 7A28 caliber, to which minor modifications are made in order to add more complications to the watch. This is where the famous Seiko 7A38 and 7A48 come from. Shown here is my Seiko 7A48, moon phase chronograph, 37mm case diameter, with original bracelet. The 7A quartz calibers were considered high-end, had great popularity and were not only fitted to Seiko watches. Small curiosity: in the second half of the 1980s the Cartier 'Ferrari Formula' had this movement.<br><br>

            <p>The Alpinist is the first sports watch from Seiko and was born in 1961 with the aim of providing Japanese climbers and other sportsmen with a reliable timepiece. The aesthetics of the watch changes a lot over the years and the SARB line introduced in 2006 with its famous design is an instant success. Probably a modern day watch enthusiast if you think about the Seiko Alpinist, view the model with green dial and brown strap, which you see here in the photo. The 38mm diameter watch, with 200m of water resistance and screw-down crown, mounts the automatic caliber 6R15, introduced for the first time in 2006. The peculiarity of the watch is the second crown at 4 o'clock, which moves the internal bezel with the indications of the 4 cardinal points.<br><br>

            <p>The Copernicus Raketa is certainly a recognizable watch and its name tells us more about its particular hands, or better spheres. The big circle (the minute hand) symbolises the Earth which rotates around the sun in 1 year, whereas the small circle (the hour hand) symbolises Jupiter which rotates around the sun in 12 years. The 35mm diameter watch is equipped with the hand-wound caliber 2609HA. This turns out to be quite spartan and simple, but all in all robust and reliable.<br><br>

            <p>I wish I could say more, but it is not easy to find information on this watch. While the automatic version seems to have been more popular, this manual winding is more difficult to find. Dating back to the 70s, this omega with integrated bracelet and angular lines confirms the trend of those years, just think of Audemars Piguet's Royal Oak, born from the pencil of Gerald Genta. Thanks to its particular lines and its blue dial it has long been my favorite watch. The watch is powered by the Omega caliber 613. Derived from the successful series of calibers 550, it differs because it is manually wound and because the gooseneck adjustment is replaced with a cheaper one.<br><br>

Better known with the names 'UFO' or 'Disco Volante' the reference 100110-1 of Universal Genéve is pretty rare.

            <p>The Zenith 1518 was the first military watch in my collection. Dated to 1943/1944, the watch was one of the many commissioned by Germany to supply its armed forces during the Second World War. Military timepieces are often characterized by a very common design, so the authenticity is often given by the assignment engraved on the caseback. In this particular model the letters D and H, respectively at the beginning and at the end. These two letters mean "Dienstuhr Heer", which we could translate as "watch in the service of the army". The number between the two letters is precisely the assignment number, which corresponded to a soldier.
            <br><br> The watch has 34 mm in diameter, is fitted with the manual manual-winding caliber 12 4-6, has a screw back, black dial, classic in military watches to reduce the visibility of the wearer, with small seconds at 6 o'clock and chromed brass case.<br><br>

The watch in question is a Zentra, with a white dial, now yellow for ageing. Unlike most military watches, which have a black dial, it is common for watches intended for the Kriegsmarine to have a light-coloured dial instead.<br><br>

The difficult availability of these watches is also due to the fact that Holland was immediately occupied by the Germans, without resistance. Many of the instruments were taken by German soldiers and today one can find Dutch army watches with the German army assignment on the back.<br><br>

            <p>With the advent of Japanese quartz watches in the 1980s, Swiss watchmaking went through a great period of crisis. The new timepieces were in fact cheaper, more precise and easier to produce. For this reason, many watchmaking companies, especially the smaller ones, have been forced to close, while others have adapted and started producing quartz watches as well. <br><br>Swatch, founded in 1983, was the Swiss answer to these Japanese watches. Characterized by particular designs and bright colors, thanks to the low production costs, due to the use of plastic as the construction material of the crates, it was very popular and successful in the 90s. To date, we can say that Swatch has indeed saved Swiss watchmaking, just think that historic brands such as Omega and Longines are part of the swatch group.<br><br>
